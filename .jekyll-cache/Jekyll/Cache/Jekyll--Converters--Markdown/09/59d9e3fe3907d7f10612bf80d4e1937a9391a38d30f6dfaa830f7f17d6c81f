I"c<p>The best resource I’ve found on understanding creation. Answers in Genesis, has taken scripture to a level of understanding that I’ve never seen before. They answer many of the questions we have about the first day and how old the earth is and where did all the languages come from with a biblical foundation.</p>

<p>Many of their lectures and presentations are free and extremely beneficial in understanding the Gospel from Genesis. I highly suggest you support them in any way possible by purchasing their books, materials and visiting their exhibits.</p>
