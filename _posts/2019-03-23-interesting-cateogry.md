The best resource Iâ€™ve found on understanding creation. Answers in Genesis, has taken scripture to a level of understanding that Iâ€™ve never seen before. They answer many of the questions we have about the first day and how old the earth is and where did all the languages come from with a biblical foundation. 

Many of their lectures and presentations are free and extremely beneficial in understanding the Gospel from Genesis. I highly suggest you support them in any way possible by purchasing their books, materials and visiting their exhibits.
